        text: 'Welcome to HealthAI Docs, Here you will find a showcase of the features developed through collaborative efforts in our group project module. Our Team members were: Luke Kiely, Finn Hoogerwerf, Xingchen Yang, and Evan Mulcare. Together, we developed a full system to tackle the following project briefâ€¦\
"The recent surge in the cost of living, particularly in the healthcare sector, has created an impetus to drive down costs\
through the use of standard AI-trained models and more specifically generative AI in the form of Large Language Models\
(LLMs).\
Furthermore, a societal transformation is taking place whereby healthcare professionals, and patients alike, are shifting\
from reactive to predictive HealthAI care management. Rather than waiting for health problems to be manifested as life-\
threatening conditions, AI technology enables the prediction of future health problems using datasets of patient\
information.\
This transformation in healthcare management has created an opportunity for your software development company to\
develop applications for this lucrative medical sector. The objective of your start-up is to develop a bespoke system which\
predicts the likelihood of someone contracting the serious medical conditions of heart disease, lung cancer and colon\
cancer. As a method of fundraising your start-up, the team will charge subscribers a monthly fee. Payments will be made\
using a payment processor such as PayPal Sandbox or Stripe."',
